# Contactless-attendance-System


 Every organization has either a card punching attendance system or bio metric attendance system where it takes a bit longer when all employees gather to punch at the reporting time. In COVID times, it is really difficult to keep up with hygiene for the attendance system as all people touch the same surface. So it is really important to have a safety measure where it saves our time too.
 
 Why don't we have a contactless attendance system where your face is identified for attendance ?
 
Attendance of the employee is very important for every organization. Conventional methodology of taking attendance is by RFID card system, Fingerprint system, Voice recognition system. But it is easy for an employee to manipulate. To stay away from these losses, an automatic process is used in this project which is based on image processing.
