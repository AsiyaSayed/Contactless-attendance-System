# Contactless-attendance-System


 Every organization has either a card punching attendance system or bio metric attendance system where it takes a bit longer when all employees gather to punch at the reporting time. In COVID times, it is really difficult to keep up with hygiene for the attendance system as all people touch the same surface. So it is really important to have a safety measure where it saves our time too.
 
 Why don't we have a contactless attendance system where your face is identified for attendance ?
